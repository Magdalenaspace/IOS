////we have to mark our class as conforming to the protocols Encodable. And this means that the Item type is now able to encode itself into a plist or into a JSON. And for a class to be able to be Encodable, all of its properties must have standard data types. So things like strings, Booleans, arrays, dictionaries, they all work, but not if you have a custom class
